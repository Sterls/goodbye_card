                    <p><b>Summer 2014 - Research Assistant</b> I had just finished year 2 and had never built an actual application, I was afraid and envious of those who had, but just did not know how to start. I had good grades but I just felt like an imposter who would never be able to be a real software developer. When you brought me in that summer, you guided me along each step, giving me digestable tasks each a big larger than the previous, until finally I had built my first app. Initially, every morning the team met for 'scrum', it was Jarred, Inzamam and I. Jarred and Inzamam belonged to the year before me and were both exceptional, thinking back, the complexity of their problems must have been vastly superior to mine but you never made it seem that way. You always encouraged me and made me feel as if my work was meaningful and complex "the kyle speech". I remember dealing with appengine, at the time it was a toddler and I was a zygote, thank you for having the patience lol. It sounds so cliche and yet understated when I say, the time I spend under you really changed my life; I went from being afraid to attempt to anything to literally believing that everything was easy to build; My freetime went from doing nothing to excitedly prepping for a competition or learning some new thing; At the time my cirlce of friends started to change, either they joined in and started to grow or we drifted; I met some of my greatest (and brightest) friends there; I can't say it enough, the experience, you were life changing.</p>

                    <p><b>The many competitions</b> It's difficult to begin because I honestly don't know where to start. A good place would be my first, Code Jam, but even here, do I say thankyou for guiding the team during our software development, reviewing our ideas and designs, listening to our silly qualms, pulling us up if necessary. Or do I start months before during the summer when you had started consistently trying to convince me to participate. </p>

                then.<br />
                I don't always heed your words right away but I will do you proud with the potential you saw in
                me.<br />
