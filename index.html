                    I cannot express how much you have done for me as both a mentor and a friend.<br/>
                    It has been 4 years now since I started working with you and you have given me alot of advice since then.<br/>
                    I don't always heed your words right away but I will do you proud with the potential you saw in me.<br/>
                    Thanks for everything :- Mikkel (And Sidone)

                	This seems kinda lame but when was the last time I wrote HTML? Maybe I should slip in some VBA for Vani O_o <br/><br/>
                    It's not easy taking the time to listen to problems and provide wise counsel while having your own work (and lives) but you guys always did. You all never made it seem like a chore either. <br/>
                    We'll definitely link soonish but once again thanks for everything!
