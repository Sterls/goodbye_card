                I do not think I have ever told you this, but you have significantly influenced the way I present/teach. I always think about how passionate you are when you talk about all of the things you've worked on and how lucrative or fun you make any opportunity sound.
                The way in which you hype a crowd with your articulate expressions is something I always admire. I look forward to the next time you use this ability to tell the Trinidad branch of the Jammers of your journey as a senior software eng in a foreign land. 
                I hope to see all the pics of all the pups you adopt and take on hikes in Canada!
